# Blackâ€“Litterman Portfolio Optimization with Factor Assets

ðŸ“Œ Implementation of the Blackâ€“Litterman (BL) model for portfolio construction, combining  
market equilibrium returns with subjective views. The project integrates factor-based asset  
selection, covariance estimation, constrained portfolio optimization, and backtesting.

## Repo Contents
- `black_litterman.ipynb` â€“ main implementation notebook  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ dependencies  
- `Outputs/` â€“ selected plots (correlation matrix, allocation comparison, risk contributions)  
- `report.pdf` â€“ extended theoretical discussion and detailed results

## How to Run

- The notebook is self-contained and designed to run autonomously.
- Some input files are fetched directly in code, while others (e.g., factors and risk-free rate time series) must be placed in the `Data/` folder.
- Source for each input data file can be found in the introduction of the notebook.

## Notes

- Plots, printed outputs, and theoretical explanations are omitted from the notebook for readability.  
  A detailed discussion of results is provided in the accompanying **PDF report**.
- Notation conventions:
  - Dates follow `YY-MM-DD`.
  - Weekly returns are used for computations; results are annualized.
  - Vectors/matrices in bold; transpose as prime ($'$); identity as $\mathbb{I}$.
